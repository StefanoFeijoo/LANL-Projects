# LANL Projects
Presentations of unclassified LANL projects

## PTC (Powder Tree Creator)
* This project shows the PTC application developed for additive manufacturing database. It is written in Python, and it uses a recursive algorithm to explore the pedigree of powder and examine the history of powder mixing. The application uses libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyQt, ete3, as well as, Python's standard libraries.
## PMT (Photomultiplier Tube) Characterization
* This poster shows a summary of setup and measurements developed for PMT characterization and Calibration. Important measurements are Quantum efficiency, Gain, and linear response. Data analysis and processing was done using Python and CERN's ROOT.
